              "description": "The Philippines’s total land area of about 30 million hectares is legally classified as alienable and disposable land and forestland. As of 2019, forestlands covered 15.8 million hectares or 52.7%, and alienable and disposable lands spanning 14.2 million hectares or 47.3% of the total land area. Of the 15.8 million hectares of forestland, which is mainly for forest use, it is further categorized into established timberland (33.5%), established forest reserves (10.9%), national parks, game refuge and bird sanctuaries, and wilderness areas (4.5%), military and naval reservations (0.4%), civil reservation (0.6%), fishponds (0.3%), and unclassified forestland (2.5%) [^1].\n \nThe Philippine Forest Cover data for 2015 was released by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The data was generated through satellite imageries and ground validation. The satellite imageries were from 2015 Land Cover Maps based on digitally classified LANDSAT 8 imageries with 30m resolution taken in 2014-2015. Based on the 2015 data, the total forest cover of the Philippines is estimated at 7.01 million hectares. Of the total forest cover, closed forest was accounted with an area of 2.03 million hectares, open forest with 4.68 million hectares, and mangrove forest with 0.30 million hectares [^1].\n \nForests are considered one of the most valuable natural resources in the Philippines [^2]. Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which are vital in building climate resilience in the country. Moreover, forests are essential in providing income and livelihood opportunities to upland communities. Upland families rely on forest resources for income and subsistence [^3].\n \nThe Philippine Master Plan for Climate Resilient Forestry Development, the country’s guide in the development and sustainable management of forests and forestlands, envisions the forestry sector to have a “Climate-resilient and sustainably managed watersheds and forest ecosystems, providing environmental and economic benefits to society.” To achieve this vision, programs and strategies identified for the sector include strengthening the resilience of forest ecosystems and communities to climate change, responding effectively to demands for forest ecosystems goods and services, and promoting responsive forest governance [^4].\n \nMoreover, based on the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions of the Philippines, it is one of the priorities of the country to pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based finance in forest conservation [^5].\n \n[^1]: DENR-FMB.

              "description": "In Indonesia all natural resources are authorized and managed by the State. State Forest Area covers about 120.5 million hectares or 64% of its total land area, which includes primary forests, secondary forests, plantation forests, and non-forested areas. Most of the remaining land area is made up of non-forest areas of public land, and is designated as Other Use Areas. In addition, 5.3 million hectares of its territorial waters have been designated as marine conservation areas within the mandate of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. These public forests and marine conservation areas are designated as Forest Areas and Marine Conservation Areas. As of December 2019, the total of these areas stands at 125.8 million hectares.\n \n State Forest Area is categorized into three different functions: Production Forest (68.8 million hectares), Protection Forest (29.6 million hectares), and Conservation Forest (22.1 million hectares of land and an additional 5.3 million hectares of marine conservation areas). The Production Forest area consists of Permanent Production Forest, Limited Production Forest, and Convertible Production Forest. Conservation Forest area is categorized into Sanctuary Reserve Areas and Nature Conservation Areas. Sanctuary Reserve Area consists of Strict Nature Reserves and Wildlife Sanctuaries. Meanwhile, Nature Conservation areas consist of National Parks, Nature Recreation Parks, and Grand Forest Parks. These areas can be terrestrial or marine. \n \n Forests in Indonesia play important roles in sustaining the economy and conserving biodiversity. For more than four decades, forest resources have played a significant role in facilitating Indonesia`s economic development through timber production. But since the decline of productivity and the euphoria of reform and autonomy in late 1990, Indonesia shifted from timber production to forest management. Forest management is oriented towards multiple uses of the nation’s forests, both timber and non-timber forest products as well as environmental services. From 2011 to 2019, fees and royalties from the forestry sector alone amounted to USD 2.18 billion. Due to its geographical location, Indonesia has an extremely high level of biodiversity and endemism. Indonesia contains 13 land-based ecosystems and six aquatic ecosystems, with 74 systems of vegetation types and abundance of bird, reptile, amphibian, mammal, freshwater fish, invertebrate, arthropod (spider), and insect species.\n \n In accordance with the vision of the President in ensuring the provision of a healthy environment for all citizens, the government through Ministry of Environment and Forestry set nationals programs. Some in highlight are: (1) for addressing deforestation and forest degradation through the One Map Policy consist of 85 thematic maps; the moratorium stood at 66.1 million hectares of the utilization of primary natural forest and peat land; Peatland restoration with target 2.49 million hectares and mangrove rehabilitation with target 637,000 hectares by 2024; using advance technologies in the National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS); ratification the ASEAN Agreement on Trans boundary Haze Pollution (AATHP), and promoting sustainable forest management practices (2) for enhancing communities involvement in sustainable forest management through the Social Forestry Programs with target 12.7 million hectares; (3) for strengthening biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management through increasing the populations of these 25 threatened species red listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), establishing of Essential Ecosystem Areas outside of the Forest Area, establishing of 1.02 million hectares (so far) of new High Conservation Value Forest outside of the Forest Area, and developing corridors connecting fragmented habitats to promote sustainable biodiversity (4) For improving the economic contribution from forestry sector, Indonesia has a mandatory national system for the certification of forest sustainability and a national chain of custody system which ensures the legality of timber (SVLK).\n \n As part of a global effort, the Indonesian Government just submitted the Update NDC of Indonesia in 2021 and the Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon and Climate Resilience 2050 (LTS-LCCR 2050), which aims to contribute to the global decarbonization goal while maintaining a national balance between emission reduction and economic growth. Indonesia’s NDC targets for reducing emissions are 29% through its own efforts, and up to 41% depending upon levels of international cooperation. \n \n [Main reference] Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF), 2020.

              "description": "With forests covering nearly 32% of its total land area that are home to nearly 8% of all the world’s plant species, Thailand is one of the most bio-diverse and forest-resource rich countries in southeast Asia [^1] [^2]. Encompassing 16.38 million ha, Thailand’s forests are primarily evergreen and deciduous with mixed deciduous types covering 14.59% of the total forest area, the largest percentage among those that are prominent. Dry evergreen (4.30%), moist evergreen (3.68%), dry dipterocarp (3.67%), montane (3.38%), and mangrove (0.48%) are also notable [^3]. Though most forest areas are in the northern region (52.46%), they are located countrywide as the central (33.16%), south (24.33%), east (22.40%) and northeastern regions (15.03%) all enjoy the forests and their benefits [^1]. \n \nThe resources provided by these expansive areas play a significant role in providing ecosystem services while also enhancing the well-being of those who utilize them. Forest biodiversity yields provisioning services such as food, medicine and fresh water, among others, and presents opportunities for households to generate basic or supplemental income. Regulating these ecosystem processes also contributes to air and soil quality, windstorm protection and pest and disease control. Also provided is the support of culture, traditions, beliefs, religions, local wisdom, recreation and ecotourism for which the forests are used.\n \nIn 2019, during the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021), Thailand reaffirmed the goal originally put forth in a 1985 policy declaration of maintaining at least 40% of the country’s total area as forests and changed the goal to 25% conservation forests and 15% economic forests [^4] [^5] [^6]. In the Paris Agreement of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Thailand also announced its intention to reduce emissions by 20% by year 2030 [^7]. These policies present significant challenges as Thailand pursues national goals toward sustainability of forest management.\n \nForest management is presently regulated nationwide by legislation such as the Forest Act B.E. 2484 (1941), National Reserved Forest Act B.E. 2507 (1964), Forest Plantation Act B.E. (2535) 1992, Chainsaw Act B.E. (2545) 2002, National Park Act B.E. (2562) 2019, Wild Animal Conservation and Protected Area Act, B.E. (2562) 2019, and the Community Forest Act B.E. (2562) 2019.\n \nThe Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MONRE) and three of its subsidiary organizations are responsible for the management of Thailand’s forest sector. The Royal Forest Department (RFD) manages reserved forests that are outside protected areas, the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) manages protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, arboretums, and forest parks, while The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMC) has authority over the mangrove forests outside protected areas.\n \nCurrently, Thailand’s forest management policy focuses on enhancing participation at the local level while balancing the environmental, social and economic benefits of utilization of forest resources with the impact on ecosystem services. In addition, the government’s approach includes collaboration with other Asian countries and in other regions in pursuit of new knowledge toward sustainable forest management.\n \n[^1]: RFD. 2020.

              "description": "Forestry in Viet Nam is a specific economic-technical sector, playing a crucial role in the national socio-economic development, ensuring the sustainable and stable development of agriculture and rural areas, protection of the environment, stabilization of the national security and defense. In the past 75 years, the forestry sector has always received attention from the Party and the State, in addition to substantial support from international development partners, the private sector, and the people. This has resulted in significant contributions to the overall growth of the agriculture and rural development sector, as well as the national economic growth and improvement of livelihoods of rural residents, especially those who depend on forests.\n \nWith geographical location and natural characteristics, forests in Viet Nam are rich in resources and biodiversity and are home to many endemic species. As of 2020, forest land occupies 45.1% of the total land area of Viet Nam [^1] while the area with forest cover is 14,677,215 ha, equivalent to 42.01% of the total land area [^2]. According to figures announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 70% of the forested area is classified as natural forests of different types (10,279,185 ha) and 30% is planted forest (4,398,030 ha) [^3].\n \nIn terms of forest use purposes, Viet Nam’s forests are classified into 3 categories — special-use forest, protection forest and production forest. As of 2020, 53.3% of the forested area is production forest (7,818,480 ha), 31.9% is protection forest (4,685,504 ha), and 14.8% is special-use forest which includes national parks and other protected areas (2,173,231 ha)\n[^4].\n \nWith regard to forest land allocation and usage rights, around 21.7% of the total forest area is allocated to individuals and households; 7.9% is allocated to village communities; 11.8% is allocated to economic organizations; 20% is under the management of the commune authorities; and 35.5% is under State management boards for special use and protection forests[5]. Nationwide, there are over 1.5 million rural households using forestry land and over 115,000 forestry households which devote most of their labor and obtain the major share of their incomes from forestry [^6].\n \nAccording to the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 and vision to 2050, the forest cover will be stable at 42-43%; the forestry sector will effectively contribute to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions as committed in the Nationally Determined Contribution for a green country of Viet Nam [^7].\n \nMoreover, based on the updated Nationally Determined Contribution of Viet Nam, by 2030, Viet Nam will have reduced its GHG emissions by 9% with domestic resources and this contribution can be raised up to 27% with international support through bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation and the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement [^8]. Of which, the forestry sector will have reduced 9.3 million tons of CO2eq with domestic resources and this contribution of the forestry sector can be increased up to 21.2 million tons of CO2eq with international support received through bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as through the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. To this end, Viet Nam will make use of domestic resources, along with cooperation and support of the international community, especially from the developed countries, in terms of finance and technology, through mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [^9] . In the forestry sector, sustainable forest management, protection, development, and utilization will be continuously concentrated and invested in order to increase carbon sequestration of forests and forest certification, significantly contributing to this commitment.\n \n[^1]: General Statistics Office (2021) Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam 2020.\n[^2]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020. \n[^3]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^4]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^5]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN (13/04/2021). \n[^6]: General Statistics Office (2016) Rural, Agriculture and Fisheries Census 2015.\n[^7]: Decision No. 523/QĐ-TTg dated 1 April 2021 by the Prime Minister on approving the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 period and vision to 2050. \n[^8]: Viet Nam’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution, July 2020.\n[^9]: Remarks of Vietnamese Prime Minister at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) held on 1 November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland.a",

              "description": "Myanmar has about 42.19% of the country’s land area covered by forest resources, accounting for 28.5 million ha. Myanmar possesses great variation in topography and climatic conditions, and six major forest types can be found in the country, ranging from mangrove forests, dry forests, deciduous dipterocarp, and hill and temperate forests. Among these, mixed deciduous forests and hill and temperate evergreen forests are the major forest types, covering an area of 38.20% and 26.92%, respectively. Of the total forest cover, the closed forest is accounted with an area of 12,260,000 ha (12.26 million ha) and the open forest is 16,284,000 ha (16.28 million ha). [^1] [^2] [^3]\n \nUnder the management of the Forest Department, Myanmar’s forest area is designated as Reserved Forest (RF), Protected Public Forest (PPF), and Protected Area (PA). The collective constitution of RF and PPF is termed as Permanent Forest Estate (PFE). RF has the best quality and high commercial value but grants no harvesting rights to the public. On the other hand, PPF gives the public some harvesting rights but has lower commercial value. PA aims to preserve diverse ecosystems and the species richness of Myanmar. [^4]\n \nAs of August, 2021, the RF area is accounted with an area of 12,017,240.5 ha (12.02 million ha), and PPF is 5,309,205.5 ha (5.31 million ha). The current achievement of country’s total PFE (RF+ PPF) is approximately about 17,326 446.0 ha (17.33 million ha) which covered 25.61% of the national target set up in the 30-years National Forestry Master Plan [3][4]. As of August, 2021, an estimated 4,121,496.25 ha of distinct forest ecosystems has been preserved under the category of Protected Area (PA) which covered 6.09% of the national target set up in the 30-years National Forestry Master Plan [^3] [^4]. Of the total PAs, 8 PAs have been designated as the ASEAN Heritage Parks, 5 PAs recognized as the Ramsar Wetland sites, and 2 PAs acknowledged as UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere Reserve-MAB [^3].\n \nForests play an important role in contributing to Myanmar’s economy, and socio-economic and well-being of the local people as over 70% of the country’s population resides in rural area and mainly depend on forest resources for food, fodder, shelter, and fuel. As deforestation surge continues in Myanmar, however, the forest cover area decreased from 57.9% of the country area in 1990 to 42.19% in 2020, ranking the seventh-most deforested country in the world [^1].\n \nThe Myanmar government has made efforts stepped up to stop deforestation through the National Forestry Master Plan, Myanmar Reforestation and Rehabilitation Programme and National REDD+ Strategy. The National Land Use Policy (2016) which is one of the main guiding elements for national land-use administration aims to promote sustainable land use management, strengthen secure land tenure and protect customary land tenure rights of the ethnic nationalities. In addition, the updated Nationally Determined Contributions in July 2021 set out the mitigation targets in the array of sectors and made a commitment to halt and reduce deforestation through promoting reforestation and rehabilitation, forest protection and conservation.\n \n[^1]: FAO. 2020.

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "During 1940s, the forest cover rate in Lao PDR was at around 70%, and then it continuously dropped and stood to at around 40% in 2010. With the efforts of the government in reforestation and rehabilitation programs nationwide, forest cover of the country increased to 58% in 2015. On the other hand, the estimated rate of forest cover of Lao PDR made by FAO showed a higher figure than the national estimation. According to the Forest Cover Assessment 2015, forest cover in Lao PDR was 79.2% of the country’s total land area or approximately 18.7 million ha with an increasing rate of 1.3% annually between 2010 and 2015. [^1]\n \nLaos currently has about 62% of forest cover, which is a high percentage compared to many other countries. Conserving these existing forests and their biodiversity – trees that have been absorbing carbon and mitigating climate change for years – will provide continual benefits for generations, far outweighing other strategies. Commercial plantations such as Eucalyptus or Acacia plantations which are cultivated solely for wood products, pulp, paper or similar materials are usually harvested for a period of 15 to 20 years, causing the trees to release much of the carbon they have stored. However, when managed sustainably, commercial plantations can protect natural forests, provide employment for local communities and contribute to the national economy.\n \nClimate change in Lao PDR is predicted to result in rising temperatures, longer dry seasons, and increased frequencies of natural disasters such as rainfall, storms, droughts and floods. Rainfall will become more erratic and weather events such as droughts or floods will become more extreme. Vulnerability towards climate change is high as Lao PDR depends on natural resources for its development. Some of Lao PDR’s major forms of natural resource utilization such as rain-fed rice cultivation and hydro-power generation are very vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. The northern and north-western parts of Laos are vulnerable to drought. Along the Mekong River, plains in the central and southern provinces are vulnerable to flood.\n \n[^1]: FAO. 2015.

For the conservation of biodiversity, approximately 51.44% of the area is set aside under a protected area network comprising national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and strict nature reserves which are well connected with biological corridors [^4]. All the forest in Bhutan is declared as State Reserved Forest Land and the Department of Forests and Park Services under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests is the focal agency for forest conservation and protection in the country.\n \nDiverse climatic conditions (subtropical, temperate, and alpine) combined with topographical variation (100-7500 meters above sea level) [^5] has attributed to the country’s diverse forest types which include subtropical forests, warm broadleaved forests, Chir pine forests, cool broadleaved forests, evergreen oak forests, blue pine forests, spruce forests, hemlock forests, fir forests, juniper-rhododendron scrubs, and dry alpine scrubs. The Cool broadleaved forest (26%) forms the major portion of the forest of Bhutan followed by warm broadleaved forest (18%) [^1].\n \n All most all the forests in the country are scientifically managed under either one of the forest management regimes; Protected Area network, Forest Management Units, Community Forests, Local Forest Management Areas, and Private Forests. The National Forest Policy (2011) requires all forests to have forest management plans focused on the sustainable supply of forest products or ecosystem services. The management plans must also ensure that pest and disease, forest fire, and natural disaster management related to the particular resources are an integral part of the plan.\n \nApart from being a source of livelihood, a major watershed, and home to some of the rarest species of flora and fauna, Bhutan’s forest is the largest carbon sink in the country [^1]. Acknowledging this, in 2009, at COP15, Bhutan made a voluntary commitment to maintaining Bhutan’s status as a net sink for greenhouse gases by ensuring that greenhouse gas emission levels do not exceed the sequestration capacity of its forests [^6]. Through its 1st Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, Bhutan further pledged its commitment to remain carbon neutral.\n \n The 2nd Nationally Determined Contribution of Bhutan highlights ambitious targets under the forest sector to strengthen the conservation of existing forests and increase the adaptive capacity to climate change impacts without compromising opportunities for future economic development and prosperity [^7]. These targets are aligned with REDD+ Strategy and Action Plan of Bhutan to; 1) improve forest management and conservation, 2) maintain at least 50% of land area as protected areas, 3) enhance forest carbon stock through climate-smart restoration, 4) initiate and promote agroforestry and 5) conserve watershed and wetlands [^8].\n \n [^1]: National Forest Inventory, Stocking Nation’s Forest Resources, Volume I, 2015 Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, Royal Government of Bhutan, Thimphu.\n [^2]: FAO. 2020.

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "In Indonesia all natural resources are authorized and managed by the State. State Forest Area covers about 120.5 million hectares or 64% of its total land area, which includes primary forests, secondary forests, plantation forests, and non-forested areas. Most of the remaining land area is made up of non-forest areas of public land, and is designated as Other Use Areas. In addition, 5.3 million hectares of its territorial waters have been designated as marine conservation areas within the mandate of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. These public forests and marine conservation areas are designated as Forest Areas and Marine Conservation Areas. As of December 2019, the total of these areas stands at 125.8 million hectares.\n \n State Forest Area is categorized into three different functions: Production Forest (68.8 million hectares), Protection Forest (29.6 million hectares), and Conservation Forest (22.1 million hectares of land and an additional 5.3 million hectares of marine conservation areas). The Production Forest area consists of Permanent Production Forest, Limited Production Forest, and Convertible Production Forest. Conservation Forest area is categorized into Sanctuary Reserve Areas and Nature Conservation Areas. Sanctuary Reserve Area consists of Strict Nature Reserves and Wildlife Sanctuaries. Meanwhile, Nature Conservation areas consist of National Parks, Nature Recreation Parks, and Grand Forest Parks. These areas can be terrestrial or marine. \n \n Forests in Indonesia play important roles in sustaining the economy and conserving biodiversity. For more than four decades, forest resources have played a significant role in facilitating Indonesia`s economic development through timber production. But since the decline of productivity and the euphoria of reform and autonomy in late 1990, Indonesia shifted from timber production to forest management. Forest management is oriented towards multiple uses of the nation’s forests, both timber and non-timber forest products as well as environmental services. From 2011 to 2019, fees and royalties from the forestry sector alone amounted to USD 2.18 billion. Due to its geographical location, Indonesia has an extremely high level of biodiversity and endemism. Indonesia contains 13 land-based ecosystems and six aquatic ecosystems, with 74 systems of vegetation types and abundance of bird, reptile, amphibian, mammal, freshwater fish, invertebrate, arthropod (spider), and insect species.\n \n In accordance with the vision of the President in ensuring the provision of a healthy environment for all citizens, the government through Ministry of Environment and Forestry set nationals programs. Some in highlight are: (1) for addressing deforestation and forest degradation through the One Map Policy consist of 85 thematic maps; the moratorium stood at 66.1 million hectares of the utilization of primary natural forest and peat land; Peatland restoration with target 2.49 million hectares and mangrove rehabilitation with target 637,000 hectares by 2024; using advance technologies in the National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS); ratification the ASEAN Agreement on Trans boundary Haze Pollution (AATHP), and promoting sustainable forest management practices (2) for enhancing communities involvement in sustainable forest management through the Social Forestry Programs with target 12.7 million hectares; (3) for strengthening biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management through increasing the populations of these 25 threatened species red listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), establishing of Essential Ecosystem Areas outside of the Forest Area, establishing of 1.02 million hectares (so far) of new High Conservation Value Forest outside of the Forest Area, and developing corridors connecting fragmented habitats to promote sustainable biodiversity (4) For improving the economic contribution from forestry sector, Indonesia has a mandatory national system for the certification of forest sustainability and a national chain of custody system which ensures the legality of timber (SVLK).\n \n As part of a global effort, the Indonesian Government just submitted the Update NDC of Indonesia in 2021 and the Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon and Climate Resilience 2050 (LTS-LCCR 2050), which aims to contribute to the global decarbonization goal while maintaining a national balance between emission reduction and economic growth. Indonesia’s NDC targets for reducing emissions are 29% through its own efforts, and up to 41% depending upon levels of international cooperation. \n \n [Main reference] Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF), 2020.

              "description": "Kazakhstan’s forests play an important role in land, wildlife, and watershed management, wind erosion and sand control, and recreation. Forests and wood land account for ha or 4.9% of the total land area in the country [^1]. Area-wise, about 70% of all wooded lands is located in the south and southeast – mostly saxaul scrub forests that are important for fuelwood production, stabilize the vegetation, and provide shade for animal grazing. The high mountain forests of the southeast and east (20% of the area) have exceptionally high biodiversity, and recreational values, as well as nut and fruit production. The forests play a key role in watershed protection. Birch and pine stands of the northern forest-steppe fragmented amidst highly productive farmland serve as a major source of fuelwood and are important for wildlife and recreation. The west and center of the country are extremely arid and fundamentally devoid of forests. Volume-wise, over 80% of the nation’s timber stock is in the north and northeast, half of it in the fir and pine forests of the East Kazakhstan Oblast where the bulk of the country’s commercial-scale harvesting is concentrated.\n \n All forests in the Republic of Kazakhstan are protected [^2]. All forests have been established under long-term management plans and they perform important water-protective, field-and soil conservation, sanitation, health, and other useful functions. About 10% of all forests in Kazakhstan were created, by the forestry authorities during Soviet times, for protection against wind erosion and sand drifts. In this regard, the forest fund category “field and forest conservation” dominates and makes 9.8 million ha or 79% of the total wooded area [^3]. Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity is 20% in 2020 [^4]. \n \n 100% of Kazakhstan’s forests are publicly owned. 79.2% of the lands of the forest fund are administered by the regional authorities (Akimats of administrative regions), 20.1% are in the conduct of the national forestry committee and 0.7 % are owned by other national agencies. The State forest fund lands include land covered with forest and land which is not forested but designed for the needs of the forestry sector. Overall, forests managed by state forest agencies account for 22.\n \n[^1]: United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

              "description": "During 1940s, the forest cover rate in Lao PDR was at around 70%, and then it continuously dropped and stood to at around 40% in 2010. With the efforts of the government in reforestation and rehabilitation programs nationwide, forest cover of the country increased to 58% in 2015. On the other hand, the estimated rate of forest cover of Lao PDR made by FAO showed a higher figure than the national estimation. According to the Forest Cover Assessment 2015, forest cover in Lao PDR was 79.2% of the country’s total land area or approximately 18.7 million ha with an increasing rate of 1.3% annually between 2010 and 2015. [^1]\n \nLaos currently has about 62% of forest cover, which is a high percentage compared to many other countries. Conserving these existing forests and their biodiversity – trees that have been absorbing carbon and mitigating climate change for years – will provide continual benefits for generations, far outweighing other strategies. Commercial plantations such as Eucalyptus or Acacia plantations which are cultivated solely for wood products, pulp, paper or similar materials are usually harvested for a period of 15 to 20 years, causing the trees to release much of the carbon they have stored. However, when managed sustainably, commercial plantations can protect natural forests, provide employment for local communities and contribute to the national economy.\n \nClimate change in Lao PDR is predicted to result in rising temperatures, longer dry seasons, and increased frequencies of natural disasters such as rainfall, storms, droughts and floods. Rainfall will become more erratic and weather events such as droughts or floods will become more extreme. Vulnerability towards climate change is high as Lao PDR depends on natural resources for its development. Some of Lao PDR’s major forms of natural resource utilization such as rain-fed rice cultivation and hydro-power generation are very vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. The northern and north-western parts of Laos are vulnerable to drought. Along the Mekong River, plains in the central and southern provinces are vulnerable to flood.\n \n[^1]: FAO. 2015.

Mongolian forest can be divided into two broad types of northern boreal forests and southern saxaul forests. Northern boreal forests, which form an ecological transition zone between the Siberian Taiga and the Central Asian Steppes, account for about 85% of the national forest estate across fourteen aimags. Southern saxual forests are found in the southern Gobi Desert and desert steppe regions.

              "description": "Myanmar has about 42.19% of the country’s land area covered by forest resources, accounting for 28.5 million ha. Myanmar possesses great variation in topography and climatic conditions, and six major forest types can be found in the country, ranging from mangrove forests, dry forests, deciduous dipterocarp, and hill and temperate forests. Among these, mixed deciduous forests and hill and temperate evergreen forests are the major forest types, covering an area of 38.20% and 26.92%, respectively. Of the total forest cover, the closed forest is accounted with an area of 12,260,000 ha (12.26 million ha) and the open forest is 16,284,000 ha (16.28 million ha). [^1] [^2] [^3]\n \nUnder the management of the Forest Department, Myanmar’s forest area is designated as Reserved Forest (RF), Protected Public Forest (PPF), and Protected Area (PA). The collective constitution of RF and PPF is termed as Permanent Forest Estate (PFE). RF has the best quality and high commercial value but grants no harvesting rights to the public. On the other hand, PPF gives the public some harvesting rights but has lower commercial value. PA aims to preserve diverse ecosystems and the species richness of Myanmar. [^4]\n \nAs of August, 2021, the RF area is accounted with an area of 12,017,240.5 ha (12.02 million ha), and PPF is 5,309,205.5 ha (5.31 million ha). The current achievement of country’s total PFE (RF+ PPF) is approximately about 17,326 446.0 ha (17.33 million ha) which covered 25.61% of the national target set up in the 30-years National Forestry Master Plan [3][4]. As of August, 2021, an estimated 4,121,496.25 ha of distinct forest ecosystems has been preserved under the category of Protected Area (PA) which covered 6.09% of the national target set up in the 30-years National Forestry Master Plan [^3] [^4]. Of the total PAs, 8 PAs have been designated as the ASEAN Heritage Parks, 5 PAs recognized as the Ramsar Wetland sites, and 2 PAs acknowledged as UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere Reserve-MAB [^3].\n \nForests play an important role in contributing to Myanmar’s economy, and socio-economic and well-being of the local people as over 70% of the country’s population resides in rural area and mainly depend on forest resources for food, fodder, shelter, and fuel. As deforestation surge continues in Myanmar, however, the forest cover area decreased from 57.9% of the country area in 1990 to 42.19% in 2020, ranking the seventh-most deforested country in the world [^1].\n \nThe Myanmar government has made efforts stepped up to stop deforestation through the National Forestry Master Plan, Myanmar Reforestation and Rehabilitation Programme and National REDD+ Strategy. The National Land Use Policy (2016) which is one of the main guiding elements for national land-use administration aims to promote sustainable land use management, strengthen secure land tenure and protect customary land tenure rights of the ethnic nationalities. In addition, the updated Nationally Determined Contributions in July 2021 set out the mitigation targets in the array of sectors and made a commitment to halt and reduce deforestation through promoting reforestation and rehabilitation, forest protection and conservation.\n \n[^1]: FAO. 2020.

As of 2019, forestlands covered 15.8 million hectares or 52.7%, and alienable and disposable lands spanning 14.2 million hectares or 47.3% of the total land area. Of the 15.8 million hectares of forestland, which is mainly for forest use, it is further categorized into established timberland (33.5%), established forest reserves (10.9%), national parks, game refuge and bird sanctuaries, and wilderness areas (4.5%), military and naval reservations (0.4%), civil reservation (0.6%), fishponds (0.3%), and unclassified forestland (2.5%) [^1].\n \nThe Philippine Forest Cover data for 2015 was released by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The data was generated through satellite imageries and ground validation. The satellite imageries were from 2015 Land Cover Maps based on digitally classified LANDSAT 8 imageries with 30m resolution taken in 2014-2015. Based on the 2015 data, the total forest cover of the Philippines is estimated at 7.01 million hectares. Of the total forest cover, closed forest was accounted with an area of 2.03 million hectares, open forest with 4.68 million hectares, and mangrove forest with 0.30 million hectares [^1].\n \nForests are considered one of the most valuable natural resources in the Philippines [^2]. Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which are vital in building climate resilience in the country. Moreover, forests are essential in providing income and livelihood opportunities to upland communities. Upland families rely on forest resources for income and subsistence [^3].\n \nThe Philippine Master Plan for Climate Resilient Forestry Development, the country’s guide in the development and sustainable management of forests and forestlands, envisions the forestry sector to have a “Climate-resilient and sustainably managed watersheds and forest ecosystems, providing environmental and economic benefits to society.” To achieve this vision, programs and strategies identified for the sector include strengthening the resilience of forest ecosystems and communities to climate change, responding effectively to demands for forest ecosystems goods and services, and promoting responsive forest governance [^4].\n \nMoreover, based on the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions of the Philippines, it is one of the priorities of the country to pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based finance in forest conservation [^5].\n \n[^1]: DENR-FMB.

              "description": "With forests covering nearly 32% of its total land area that are home to nearly 8% of all the world’s plant species, Thailand is one of the most bio-diverse and forest-resource rich countries in southeast Asia [^1] [^2]. Encompassing 16.38 million ha, Thailand’s forests are primarily evergreen and deciduous with mixed deciduous types covering 14.59% of the total forest area, the largest percentage among those that are prominent. Dry evergreen (4.30%), moist evergreen (3.68%), dry dipterocarp (3.67%), montane (3.38%), and mangrove (0.48%) are also notable [^3]. Though most forest areas are in the northern region (52.46%), they are located countrywide as the central (33.16%), south (24.33%), east (22.40%) and northeastern regions (15.03%) all enjoy the forests and their benefits [^1]. \n \nThe resources provided by these expansive areas play a significant role in providing ecosystem services while also enhancing the well-being of those who utilize them. Forest biodiversity yields provisioning services such as food, medicine and fresh water, among others, and presents opportunities for households to generate basic or supplemental income. Regulating these ecosystem processes also contributes to air and soil quality, windstorm protection and pest and disease control. Also provided is the support of culture, traditions, beliefs, religions, local wisdom, recreation and ecotourism for which the forests are used.\n \nIn 2019, during the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021), Thailand reaffirmed the goal originally put forth in a 1985 policy declaration of maintaining at least 40% of the country’s total area as forests and changed the goal to 25% conservation forests and 15% economic forests [^4] [^5] [^6]. In the Paris Agreement of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Thailand also announced its intention to reduce emissions by 20% by year 2030 [^7]. These policies present significant challenges as Thailand pursues national goals toward sustainability of forest management.\n \nForest management is presently regulated nationwide by legislation such as the Forest Act B.E. 2484 (1941), National Reserved Forest Act B.E. 2507 (1964), Forest Plantation Act B.E. (2535) 1992, Chainsaw Act B.E. (2545) 2002, National Park Act B.E. (2562) 2019, Wild Animal Conservation and Protected Area Act, B.E. (2562) 2019, and the Community Forest Act B.E. (2562) 2019.\n \nThe Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MONRE) and three of its subsidiary organizations are responsible for the management of Thailand’s forest sector. The Royal Forest Department (RFD) manages reserved forests that are outside protected areas, the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) manages protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, arboretums, and forest parks, while The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMC) has authority over the mangrove forests outside protected areas.\n \nCurrently, Thailand’s forest management policy focuses on enhancing participation at the local level while balancing the environmental, social and economic benefits of utilization of forest resources with the impact on ecosystem services. In addition, the government’s approach includes collaboration with other Asian countries and in other regions in pursuit of new knowledge toward sustainable forest management.\n \n[^1]: RFD. 2020.

According to the FAO, 61.94% or about 921.1 thousand ha of Timor-Leste is forested as of 2020 [^2]. Since 1990, there has been no planted forest, thus, naturally regenerating forest accounts for 100% of the forest area. Between 1990 and 2020, the country lost 42 thousand ha of its forest cover. In addition, Forest growing stock which recorded 96.31 million m³ over bark in 1990 decreased to 92.11 million m³ over bark in 2020. However, carbon stock in biomass has had no change from 90.24 tonnes/ha since 1990.\n \nAccording to the 2012 data for land use and land cover, forest land is divided into 3 types: Sparse forest (37.7%), Dense forest (21.2%), and Very sparse forest (4.3%) [^3], Among them, there are negative trends showing a loss of dense forests and destruction of sparse forests primarily due to deforestation and illegal logging directly, and ineffective law enforcement indirectly [^4]. Also, watershed and land degradation, loss of soil fertility and biodiversity, and excessive runoff and soil erosion occur as farmers practice deforestation activities in order to expand their crop production areas and pervasive demographic pressures and poverty in the country[^5].\n  \nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) is the main government department responsible for development forestry. The Director General of Forestry, Coffee, and Industrial Plants (DG-FCPI) is one of the Ministry’s four general directorates and holds broad responsibilities for community forest, watershed management hydrographic, forest protection, forest plantation, development of protected natural areas and other aspects of development forestry.\n \nThe Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2011-2030 recognizes that the priority is to “increase social capital and improve the country’s infrastructure, supported by an emphasis on strategies for management of natural resources and environmental care and protection.” [^6] The general objective of the national forest policy remains: sustainable management of forest resources and watersheds in order to provide environmental, social and economic benefits to people of Timor-Leste. The Specific objectives of the Forest Policy are 1) Forest Protection and Management, 2) Reforestation and Soil Restoration, 3) Watershed Conservation, 4) Community and Private Participation in Forestry, 5) Private Sector Development, 6.

              "description": "Forestry in Viet Nam is a specific economic-technical sector, playing a crucial role in the national socio-economic development, ensuring the sustainable and stable development of agriculture and rural areas, protection of the environment, stabilization of the national security and defense. In the past 75 years, the forestry sector has always received attention from the Party and the State, in addition to substantial support from international development partners, the private sector, and the people. This has resulted in significant contributions to the overall growth of the agriculture and rural development sector, as well as the national economic growth and improvement of livelihoods of rural residents, especially those who depend on forests.\n \nWith geographical location and natural characteristics, forests in Viet Nam are rich in resources and biodiversity and are home to many endemic species. As of 2020, forest land occupies 45.1% of the total land area of Viet Nam [^1] while the area with forest cover is 14,677,215 ha, equivalent to 42.01% of the total land area [^2]. According to figures announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 70% of the forested area is classified as natural forests of different types (10,279,185 ha) and 30% is planted forest (4,398,030 ha) [^3].\n \nIn terms of forest use purposes, Viet Nam’s forests are classified into 3 categories — special-use forest, protection forest and production forest. As of 2020, 53.3% of the forested area is production forest (7,818,480 ha), 31.9% is protection forest (4,685,504 ha), and 14.8% is special-use forest which includes national parks and other protected areas (2,173,231 ha)\n[^4].\n \nWith regard to forest land allocation and usage rights, around 21.7% of the total forest area is allocated to individuals and households; 7.9% is allocated to village communities; 11.8% is allocated to economic organizations; 20% is under the management of the commune authorities; and 35.5% is under State management boards for special use and protection forests[5]. Nationwide, there are over 1.5 million rural households using forestry land and over 115,000 forestry households which devote most of their labor and obtain the major share of their incomes from forestry [^6].\n \nAccording to the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 and vision to 2050, the forest cover will be stable at 42-43%; the forestry sector will effectively contribute to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions as committed in the Nationally Determined Contribution for a green country of Viet Nam [^7].\n \nMoreover, based on the updated Nationally Determined Contribution of Viet Nam, by 2030, Viet Nam will have reduced its GHG emissions by 9% with domestic resources and this contribution can be raised up to 27% with international support through bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation and the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement [^8]. Of which, the forestry sector will have reduced 9.3 million tons of CO2eq with domestic resources and this contribution of the forestry sector can be increased up to 21.2 million tons of CO2eq with international support received through bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as through the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. To this end, Viet Nam will make use of domestic resources, along with cooperation and support of the international community, especially from the developed countries, in terms of finance and technology, through mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [^9] . In the forestry sector, sustainable forest management, protection, development, and utilization will be continuously concentrated and invested in order to increase carbon sequestration of forests and forest certification, significantly contributing to this commitment.\n \n[^1]: General Statistics Office (2021) Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam 2020.\n[^2]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020. \n[^3]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^4]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^5]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN (13/04/2021). \n[^6]: General Statistics Office (2016) Rural, Agriculture and Fisheries Census 2015.\n[^7]: Decision No. 523/QĐ-TTg dated 1 April 2021 by the Prime Minister on approving the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 period and vision to 2050. \n[^8]: Viet Nam’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution, July 2020.\n[^9]: Remarks of Vietnamese Prime Minister at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) held on 1 November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland.a",

In the past 75 years, the forestry sector has always received attention from the Party and the State, in addition to substantial support from international development partners, the private sector, and the people. This has resulted in significant contributions to the overall growth of the agriculture and rural development sector, as well as the national economic growth and improvement of livelihoods of rural residents, especially those who depend on forests.\n \nWith geographical location and natural characteristics, forests in Viet Nam are rich in resources and biodiversity and are home to many endemic species. As of 2020, forest land occupies 45.1% of the total land area of Viet Nam [^1] while the area with forest cover is 14,677,215 ha, equivalent to 42.01% of the total land area [^2]. According to figures announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 70% of the forested area is classified as natural forests of different types (10,279,185 ha) and 30% is planted forest (4,398,030 ha) [^3].\n \nIn terms of forest use purposes, Viet Nam’s forests are classified into 3 categories — special-use forest, protection forest and production forest. As of 2020, 53.3% of the forested area is production forest (7,818,480 ha), 31.9% is protection forest (4,685,504 ha), and 14.8% is special-use forest which includes national parks and other protected areas (2,173,231 ha)\n[^4].\n \nWith regard to forest land allocation and usage rights, around 21.7% of the total forest area is allocated to individuals and households; 7.9% is allocated to village communities; 11.8% is allocated to economic organizations; 20% is under the management of the commune authorities; and 35.5% is under State management boards for special use and protection forests[5]. Nationwide, there are over 1.5 million rural households using forestry land and over 115,000 forestry households which devote most of their labor and obtain the major share of their incomes from forestry [^6].\n \nAccording to the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 and vision to 2050, the forest cover will be stable at 42-43%; the forestry sector will effectively contribute to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions as committed in the Nationally Determined Contribution for a green country of Viet Nam [^7].\n \nMoreover, based on the updated Nationally Determined Contribution of Viet Nam, by 2030, Viet Nam will have reduced its GHG emissions by 9% with domestic resources and this contribution can be raised up to 27% with international support through bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation and the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement [^8]. Of which, the forestry sector will have reduced 9.3 million tons of CO2eq with domestic resources and this contribution of the forestry sector can be increased up to 21.2 million tons of CO2eq with international support received through bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as through the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. To this end, Viet Nam will make use of domestic resources, along with cooperation and support of the international community, especially from the developed countries, in terms of finance and technology, through mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [^9] . In the forestry sector, sustainable forest management, protection, development, and utilization will be continuously concentrated and invested in order to increase carbon sequestration of forests and forest certification, significantly contributing to this commitment.\n \n[^1]: General Statistics Office (2021) Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam 2020.\n[^2]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020. \n[^3]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^4]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^5]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN (13/04/2021). \n[^6]: General Statistics Office (2016) Rural, Agriculture and Fisheries Census 2015.\n[^7]: Decision No. 523/QĐ-TTg dated 1 April 2021 by the Prime Minister on approving the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 period and vision to 2050. \n[^8]: Viet Nam’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution, July 2020.\n[^9]: Remarks of Vietnamese Prime Minister at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) held on 1 November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland.a",

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "Forest occupies a total of 71 % (2.7 million ha) of the total geographical area (3.8 million ha) of Bhutan [^1] [^2] and even the constitution of Bhutan mandates to maintain at least 60% of forest cover in perpetuity [^3]. For the conservation of biodiversity, approximately 51.44% of the area is set aside under a protected area network comprising national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and strict nature reserves which are well connected with biological corridors [^4]. All the forest in Bhutan is declared as State Reserved Forest Land and the Department of Forests and Park Services under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests is the focal agency for forest conservation and protection in the country.\n \nDiverse climatic conditions (subtropical, temperate, and alpine) combined with topographical variation (100-7500 meters above sea level) [^5] has attributed to the country’s diverse forest types which include subtropical forests, warm broadleaved forests, Chir pine forests, cool broadleaved forests, evergreen oak forests, blue pine forests, spruce forests, hemlock forests, fir forests, juniper-rhododendron scrubs, and dry alpine scrubs. The Cool broadleaved forest (26%) forms the major portion of the forest of Bhutan followed by warm broadleaved forest (18%) [^1].\n \n All most all the forests in the country are scientifically managed under either one of the forest management regimes; Protected Area network, Forest Management Units, Community Forests, Local Forest Management Areas, and Private Forests. The National Forest Policy (2011) requires all forests to have forest management plans focused on the sustainable supply of forest products or ecosystem services. The management plans must also ensure that pest and disease, forest fire, and natural disaster management related to the particular resources are an integral part of the plan.\n \nApart from being a source of livelihood, a major watershed, and home to some of the rarest species of flora and fauna, Bhutan’s forest is the largest carbon sink in the country [^1]. Acknowledging this, in 2009, at COP15, Bhutan made a voluntary commitment to maintaining Bhutan’s status as a net sink for greenhouse gases by ensuring that greenhouse gas emission levels do not exceed the sequestration capacity of its forests [^6]. Through its 1st Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, Bhutan further pledged its commitment to remain carbon neutral.\n \n The 2nd Nationally Determined Contribution of Bhutan highlights ambitious targets under the forest sector to strengthen the conservation of existing forests and increase the adaptive capacity to climate change impacts without compromising opportunities for future economic development and prosperity [^7]. These targets are aligned with REDD+ Strategy and Action Plan of Bhutan to; 1) improve forest management and conservation, 2) maintain at least 50% of land area as protected areas, 3) enhance forest carbon stock through climate-smart restoration, 4) initiate and promote agroforestry and 5) conserve watershed and wetlands [^8].\n \n [^1]: National Forest Inventory, Stocking Nation’s Forest Resources, Volume I, 2015 Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, Royal Government of Bhutan, Thimphu.\n [^2]: FAO. 2020.

              "description": "The Philippines’s total land area of about 30 million hectares is legally classified as alienable and disposable land and forestland. As of 2019, forestlands covered 15.8 million hectares or 52.7%, and alienable and disposable lands spanning 14.2 million hectares or 47.3% of the total land area. Of the 15.8 million hectares of forestland, which is mainly for forest use, it is further categorized into established timberland (33.5%), established forest reserves (10.9%), national parks, game refuge and bird sanctuaries, and wilderness areas (4.5%), military and naval reservations (0.4%), civil reservation (0.6%), fishponds (0.3%), and unclassified forestland (2.5%) [^1].\n \nThe Philippine Forest Cover data for 2015 was released by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The data was generated through satellite imageries and ground validation. The satellite imageries were from 2015 Land Cover Maps based on digitally classified LANDSAT 8 imageries with 30m resolution taken in 2014-2015. Based on the 2015 data, the total forest cover of the Philippines is estimated at 7.01 million hectares. Of the total forest cover, closed forest was accounted with an area of 2.03 million hectares, open forest with 4.68 million hectares, and mangrove forest with 0.30 million hectares [^1].\n \nForests are considered one of the most valuable natural resources in the Philippines [^2]. Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which are vital in building climate resilience in the country. Moreover, forests are essential in providing income and livelihood opportunities to upland communities. Upland families rely on forest resources for income and subsistence [^3].\n \nThe Philippine Master Plan for Climate Resilient Forestry Development, the country’s guide in the development and sustainable management of forests and forestlands, envisions the forestry sector to have a “Climate-resilient and sustainably managed watersheds and forest ecosystems, providing environmental and economic benefits to society.” To achieve this vision, programs and strategies identified for the sector include strengthening the resilience of forest ecosystems and communities to climate change, responding effectively to demands for forest ecosystems goods and services, and promoting responsive forest governance [^4].\n \nMoreover, based on the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions of the Philippines, it is one of the priorities of the country to pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based finance in forest conservation [^5].\n \n[^1]: DENR-FMB.

              "description": "Malaysia is a federation of thirteen States and three Federal Territories with eleven of the States and the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya located in Peninsular Malaysia, while the State of Sabah together with the Federal Territory of Labuan and the State of Sarawak are located in the island of Borneo respectively. The total land area of Malaysia is estimated to be 32.83 million ha with Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak having 13.16 million ha, 7.37 million ha, and 12.30 million ha respectively. Peninsular Malaysia is separated from Sabah and Sarawak by 720 km of the South China Sea, giving the country a coastline of almost 4,830 km. \n \nAt the end of 2005, total land under forests in Malaysia was estimated to be 18.31 million ha or 55.8 percent of its total land area; lands under perennial agricultural tree crops such as rubber, oil palm, cocoa and coconut, and those under other land usage such as for settlements and infrastructural development totaled 5.55 million ha or 16.9 percent and 8.97 million ha or 27.3 percent of its total land area respectively. Hence, at the end of 2005, Malaysia had a total tree cover of 23.86 million ha or 72.7 percent of its total land area. \n \nMalaysia has also declared a total of five areas as RAMSAR sites covering 48,029 ha, while the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has recognized and declared the Kinabalu Park, covering an area of 75,370 ha in Sabah, and the Gunung Mulu National Park, covering an area of 52,865 ha in Sarawak as World Heritage Sites. In addition, UNESCO has also listed the Langkawi Geopark, covering 47,800 ha in the island of Langkawi, in its global network of Geoparks in June 2007. In February 2007, Malaysia together with Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia had embarked on the Heart of Borneo initiative which has designated 24 million ha as protected areas, production forests and sustainable land-use areas. \n \nIn terms of forest conservation, actions should be taken to secure a minimum set of strategically located primary forests in representative areas having high diversity and endemism, taking into account the need for biological corridors linking them or ‘stepping stones’ between them, as well as in enhancing in situ conservation of biological diversity during forest harvesting. The cost in protecting and managing the existing biological reserves and the opportunity cost foregone in implementing in situ conservation of biological diversity and its potential use in the light of advances in biotechnologies in using the resources should be quantified. In this regard, the issue of patents and intellectual property rights (IPRs) and patents of products, including biotechnological products derived from the use of forest genetic resources should be addressed, taking into account the National Biotechnology Policy 2005.\n \n [^1]: FAO.2009.Malaysia Forestry Outlook Study.",

              "description": "With forests covering nearly 32% of its total land area that are home to nearly 8% of all the world’s plant species, Thailand is one of the most bio-diverse and forest-resource rich countries in southeast Asia [^1] [^2]. Encompassing 16.38 million ha, Thailand’s forests are primarily evergreen and deciduous with mixed deciduous types covering 14.59% of the total forest area, the largest percentage among those that are prominent. Dry evergreen (4.30%), moist evergreen (3.68%), dry dipterocarp (3.67%), montane (3.38%), and mangrove (0.48%) are also notable [^3]. Though most forest areas are in the northern region (52.46%), they are located countrywide as the central (33.16%), south (24.33%), east (22.40%) and northeastern regions (15.03%) all enjoy the forests and their benefits [^1]. \n \nThe resources provided by these expansive areas play a significant role in providing ecosystem services while also enhancing the well-being of those who utilize them. Forest biodiversity yields provisioning services such as food, medicine and fresh water, among others, and presents opportunities for households to generate basic or supplemental income. Regulating these ecosystem processes also contributes to air and soil quality, windstorm protection and pest and disease control. Also provided is the support of culture, traditions, beliefs, religions, local wisdom, recreation and ecotourism for which the forests are used.\n \nIn 2019, during the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021), Thailand reaffirmed the goal originally put forth in a 1985 policy declaration of maintaining at least 40% of the country’s total area as forests and changed the goal to 25% conservation forests and 15% economic forests [^4] [^5] [^6]. In the Paris Agreement of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Thailand also announced its intention to reduce emissions by 20% by year 2030 [^7]. These policies present significant challenges as Thailand pursues national goals toward sustainability of forest management.\n \nForest management is presently regulated nationwide by legislation such as the Forest Act B.E. 2484 (1941), National Reserved Forest Act B.E. 2507 (1964), Forest Plantation Act B.E. (2535) 1992, Chainsaw Act B.E. (2545) 2002, National Park Act B.E. (2562) 2019, Wild Animal Conservation and Protected Area Act, B.E. (2562) 2019, and the Community Forest Act B.E. (2562) 2019.\n \nThe Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MONRE) and three of its subsidiary organizations are responsible for the management of Thailand’s forest sector. The Royal Forest Department (RFD) manages reserved forests that are outside protected areas, the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) manages protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, arboretums, and forest parks, while The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMC) has authority over the mangrove forests outside protected areas.\n \nCurrently, Thailand’s forest management policy focuses on enhancing participation at the local level while balancing the environmental, social and economic benefits of utilization of forest resources with the impact on ecosystem services. In addition, the government’s approach includes collaboration with other Asian countries and in other regions in pursuit of new knowledge toward sustainable forest management.\n \n[^1]: RFD. 2020.

              "description": "The Philippines’s total land area of about 30 million hectares is legally classified as alienable and disposable land and forestland. As of 2019, forestlands covered 15.8 million hectares or 52.7%, and alienable and disposable lands spanning 14.2 million hectares or 47.3% of the total land area. Of the 15.8 million hectares of forestland, which is mainly for forest use, it is further categorized into established timberland (33.5%), established forest reserves (10.9%), national parks, game refuge and bird sanctuaries, and wilderness areas (4.5%), military and naval reservations (0.4%), civil reservation (0.6%), fishponds (0.3%), and unclassified forestland (2.5%) [^1].\n \nThe Philippine Forest Cover data for 2015 was released by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The data was generated through satellite imageries and ground validation. The satellite imageries were from 2015 Land Cover Maps based on digitally classified LANDSAT 8 imageries with 30m resolution taken in 2014-2015. Based on the 2015 data, the total forest cover of the Philippines is estimated at 7.01 million hectares. Of the total forest cover, closed forest was accounted with an area of 2.03 million hectares, open forest with 4.68 million hectares, and mangrove forest with 0.30 million hectares [^1].\n \nForests are considered one of the most valuable natural resources in the Philippines [^2]. Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which are vital in building climate resilience in the country. Moreover, forests are essential in providing income and livelihood opportunities to upland communities. Upland families rely on forest resources for income and subsistence [^3].\n \nThe Philippine Master Plan for Climate Resilient Forestry Development, the country’s guide in the development and sustainable management of forests and forestlands, envisions the forestry sector to have a “Climate-resilient and sustainably managed watersheds and forest ecosystems, providing environmental and economic benefits to society.” To achieve this vision, programs and strategies identified for the sector include strengthening the resilience of forest ecosystems and communities to climate change, responding effectively to demands for forest ecosystems goods and services, and promoting responsive forest governance [^4].\n \nMoreover, based on the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions of the Philippines, it is one of the priorities of the country to pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based finance in forest conservation [^5].\n \n[^1]: DENR-FMB.

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "With forests covering nearly 32% of its total land area that are home to nearly 8% of all the world’s plant species, Thailand is one of the most bio-diverse and forest-resource rich countries in southeast Asia [^1] [^2]. Encompassing 16.38 million ha, Thailand’s forests are primarily evergreen and deciduous with mixed deciduous types covering 14.59% of the total forest area, the largest percentage among those that are prominent. Dry evergreen (4.30%), moist evergreen (3.68%), dry dipterocarp (3.67%), montane (3.38%), and mangrove (0.48%) are also notable [^3]. Though most forest areas are in the northern region (52.46%), they are located countrywide as the central (33.16%), south (24.33%), east (22.40%) and northeastern regions (15.03%) all enjoy the forests and their benefits [^1]. \n \nThe resources provided by these expansive areas play a significant role in providing ecosystem services while also enhancing the well-being of those who utilize them. Forest biodiversity yields provisioning services such as food, medicine and fresh water, among others, and presents opportunities for households to generate basic or supplemental income. Regulating these ecosystem processes also contributes to air and soil quality, windstorm protection and pest and disease control. Also provided is the support of culture, traditions, beliefs, religions, local wisdom, recreation and ecotourism for which the forests are used.\n \nIn 2019, during the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017-2021), Thailand reaffirmed the goal originally put forth in a 1985 policy declaration of maintaining at least 40% of the country’s total area as forests and changed the goal to 25% conservation forests and 15% economic forests [^4] [^5] [^6]. In the Paris Agreement of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), Thailand also announced its intention to reduce emissions by 20% by year 2030 [^7]. These policies present significant challenges as Thailand pursues national goals toward sustainability of forest management.\n \nForest management is presently regulated nationwide by legislation such as the Forest Act B.E. 2484 (1941), National Reserved Forest Act B.E. 2507 (1964), Forest Plantation Act B.E. (2535) 1992, Chainsaw Act B.E. (2545) 2002, National Park Act B.E. (2562) 2019, Wild Animal Conservation and Protected Area Act, B.E. (2562) 2019, and the Community Forest Act B.E. (2562) 2019.\n \nThe Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MONRE) and three of its subsidiary organizations are responsible for the management of Thailand’s forest sector. The Royal Forest Department (RFD) manages reserved forests that are outside protected areas, the Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) manages protected areas such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, arboretums, and forest parks, while The Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMC) has authority over the mangrove forests outside protected areas.\n \nCurrently, Thailand’s forest management policy focuses on enhancing participation at the local level while balancing the environmental, social and economic benefits of utilization of forest resources with the impact on ecosystem services. In addition, the government’s approach includes collaboration with other Asian countries and in other regions in pursuit of new knowledge toward sustainable forest management.\n \n[^1]: RFD. 2020.

              "description": "Forestry in Viet Nam is a specific economic-technical sector, playing a crucial role in the national socio-economic development, ensuring the sustainable and stable development of agriculture and rural areas, protection of the environment, stabilization of the national security and defense. In the past 75 years, the forestry sector has always received attention from the Party and the State, in addition to substantial support from international development partners, the private sector, and the people. This has resulted in significant contributions to the overall growth of the agriculture and rural development sector, as well as the national economic growth and improvement of livelihoods of rural residents, especially those who depend on forests.\n \nWith geographical location and natural characteristics, forests in Viet Nam are rich in resources and biodiversity and are home to many endemic species. As of 2020, forest land occupies 45.1% of the total land area of Viet Nam [^1] while the area with forest cover is 14,677,215 ha, equivalent to 42.01% of the total land area [^2]. According to figures announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, 70% of the forested area is classified as natural forests of different types (10,279,185 ha) and 30% is planted forest (4,398,030 ha) [^3].\n \nIn terms of forest use purposes, Viet Nam’s forests are classified into 3 categories — special-use forest, protection forest and production forest. As of 2020, 53.3% of the forested area is production forest (7,818,480 ha), 31.9% is protection forest (4,685,504 ha), and 14.8% is special-use forest which includes national parks and other protected areas (2,173,231 ha)\n[^4].\n \nWith regard to forest land allocation and usage rights, around 21.7% of the total forest area is allocated to individuals and households; 7.9% is allocated to village communities; 11.8% is allocated to economic organizations; 20% is under the management of the commune authorities; and 35.5% is under State management boards for special use and protection forests[5]. Nationwide, there are over 1.5 million rural households using forestry land and over 115,000 forestry households which devote most of their labor and obtain the major share of their incomes from forestry [^6].\n \nAccording to the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 and vision to 2050, the forest cover will be stable at 42-43%; the forestry sector will effectively contribute to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions as committed in the Nationally Determined Contribution for a green country of Viet Nam [^7].\n \nMoreover, based on the updated Nationally Determined Contribution of Viet Nam, by 2030, Viet Nam will have reduced its GHG emissions by 9% with domestic resources and this contribution can be raised up to 27% with international support through bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation and the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement [^8]. Of which, the forestry sector will have reduced 9.3 million tons of CO2eq with domestic resources and this contribution of the forestry sector can be increased up to 21.2 million tons of CO2eq with international support received through bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as through the implementation of new mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. To this end, Viet Nam will make use of domestic resources, along with cooperation and support of the international community, especially from the developed countries, in terms of finance and technology, through mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [^9] . In the forestry sector, sustainable forest management, protection, development, and utilization will be continuously concentrated and invested in order to increase carbon sequestration of forests and forest certification, significantly contributing to this commitment.\n \n[^1]: General Statistics Office (2021) Statistical Yearbook of Viet Nam 2020.\n[^2]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020. \n[^3]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^4]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN dated 13 April 2021) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Announcement of the National Forest Status in 2020.\n[^5]: Decision No.1558/QD-BNN-TCLN (13/04/2021). \n[^6]: General Statistics Office (2016) Rural, Agriculture and Fisheries Census 2015.\n[^7]: Decision No. 523/QĐ-TTg dated 1 April 2021 by the Prime Minister on approving the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy for the 2021-2030 period and vision to 2050. \n[^8]: Viet Nam’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution, July 2020.\n[^9]: Remarks of Vietnamese Prime Minister at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) held on 1 November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland.a",

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "Timor-Leste is a Southeast Asian nation with a total land area of about 14,870 square km, largely mountainous areas [^1]. According to the FAO, 61.94% or about 921.1 thousand ha of Timor-Leste is forested as of 2020 [^2]. Since 1990, there has been no planted forest, thus, naturally regenerating forest accounts for 100% of the forest area. Between 1990 and 2020, the country lost 42 thousand ha of its forest cover. In addition, Forest growing stock which recorded 96.31 million m³ over bark in 1990 decreased to 92.11 million m³ over bark in 2020. However, carbon stock in biomass has had no change from 90.24 tonnes/ha since 1990.\n \nAccording to the 2012 data for land use and land cover, forest land is divided into 3 types: Sparse forest (37.7%), Dense forest (21.2%), and Very sparse forest (4.3%) [^3], Among them, there are negative trends showing a loss of dense forests and destruction of sparse forests primarily due to deforestation and illegal logging directly, and ineffective law enforcement indirectly [^4]. Also, watershed and land degradation, loss of soil fertility and biodiversity, and excessive runoff and soil erosion occur as farmers practice deforestation activities in order to expand their crop production areas and pervasive demographic pressures and poverty in the country[^5].\n  \nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) is the main government department responsible for development forestry. The Director General of Forestry, Coffee, and Industrial Plants (DG-FCPI) is one of the Ministry’s four general directorates and holds broad responsibilities for community forest, watershed management hydrographic, forest protection, forest plantation, development of protected natural areas and other aspects of development forestry.\n \nThe Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2011-2030 recognizes that the priority is to “increase social capital and improve the country’s infrastructure, supported by an emphasis on strategies for management of natural resources and environmental care and protection.” [^6] The general objective of the national forest policy remains: sustainable management of forest resources and watersheds in order to provide environmental, social and economic benefits to people of Timor-Leste. The Specific objectives of the Forest Policy are 1) Forest Protection and Management, 2) Reforestation and Soil Restoration, 3) Watershed Conservation, 4) Community and Private Participation in Forestry, 5) Private Sector Development, 6. Institutional Development. In order to achieve the objectives, 4 major instruments will be deployed as follows: 1) Forest and Basin Management Instruments, 2) Instruments for the Use of Forest Products, 3) Knowledge and Information Tools, 4) Governance and Legislative Instruments.\n \n[^1]: The World Bank, World Development Indicators (2020).

              "description": "In Indonesia all natural resources are authorized and managed by the State. State Forest Area covers about 120.5 million hectares or 64% of its total land area, which includes primary forests, secondary forests, plantation forests, and non-forested areas. Most of the remaining land area is made up of non-forest areas of public land, and is designated as Other Use Areas. In addition, 5.3 million hectares of its territorial waters have been designated as marine conservation areas within the mandate of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. These public forests and marine conservation areas are designated as Forest Areas and Marine Conservation Areas. As of December 2019, the total of these areas stands at 125.8 million hectares.\n \n State Forest Area is categorized into three different functions: Production Forest (68.8 million hectares), Protection Forest (29.6 million hectares), and Conservation Forest (22.1 million hectares of land and an additional 5.3 million hectares of marine conservation areas). The Production Forest area consists of Permanent Production Forest, Limited Production Forest, and Convertible Production Forest. Conservation Forest area is categorized into Sanctuary Reserve Areas and Nature Conservation Areas. Sanctuary Reserve Area consists of Strict Nature Reserves and Wildlife Sanctuaries. Meanwhile, Nature Conservation areas consist of National Parks, Nature Recreation Parks, and Grand Forest Parks. These areas can be terrestrial or marine. \n \n Forests in Indonesia play important roles in sustaining the economy and conserving biodiversity. For more than four decades, forest resources have played a significant role in facilitating Indonesia`s economic development through timber production. But since the decline of productivity and the euphoria of reform and autonomy in late 1990, Indonesia shifted from timber production to forest management. Forest management is oriented towards multiple uses of the nation’s forests, both timber and non-timber forest products as well as environmental services. From 2011 to 2019, fees and royalties from the forestry sector alone amounted to USD 2.18 billion. Due to its geographical location, Indonesia has an extremely high level of biodiversity and endemism. Indonesia contains 13 land-based ecosystems and six aquatic ecosystems, with 74 systems of vegetation types and abundance of bird, reptile, amphibian, mammal, freshwater fish, invertebrate, arthropod (spider), and insect species.\n \n In accordance with the vision of the President in ensuring the provision of a healthy environment for all citizens, the government through Ministry of Environment and Forestry set nationals programs. Some in highlight are: (1) for addressing deforestation and forest degradation through the One Map Policy consist of 85 thematic maps; the moratorium stood at 66.1 million hectares of the utilization of primary natural forest and peat land; Peatland restoration with target 2.49 million hectares and mangrove rehabilitation with target 637,000 hectares by 2024; using advance technologies in the National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS); ratification the ASEAN Agreement on Trans boundary Haze Pollution (AATHP), and promoting sustainable forest management practices (2) for enhancing communities involvement in sustainable forest management through the Social Forestry Programs with target 12.7 million hectares; (3) for strengthening biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management through increasing the populations of these 25 threatened species red listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), establishing of Essential Ecosystem Areas outside of the Forest Area, establishing of 1.02 million hectares (so far) of new High Conservation Value Forest outside of the Forest Area, and developing corridors connecting fragmented habitats to promote sustainable biodiversity (4) For improving the economic contribution from forestry sector, Indonesia has a mandatory national system for the certification of forest sustainability and a national chain of custody system which ensures the legality of timber (SVLK).\n \n As part of a global effort, the Indonesian Government just submitted the Update NDC of Indonesia in 2021 and the Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon and Climate Resilience 2050 (LTS-LCCR 2050), which aims to contribute to the global decarbonization goal while maintaining a national balance between emission reduction and economic growth. Indonesia’s NDC targets for reducing emissions are 29% through its own efforts, and up to 41% depending upon levels of international cooperation. \n \n [Main reference] Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF), 2020.

Of the 15.8 million hectares of forestland, which is mainly for forest use, it is further categorized into established timberland (33.5%), established forest reserves (10.9%), national parks, game refuge and bird sanctuaries, and wilderness areas (4.5%), military and naval reservations (0.4%), civil reservation (0.6%), fishponds (0.3%), and unclassified forestland (2.5%) [^1].\n \nThe Philippine Forest Cover data for 2015 was released by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The data was generated through satellite imageries and ground validation. The satellite imageries were from 2015 Land Cover Maps based on digitally classified LANDSAT 8 imageries with 30m resolution taken in 2014-2015. Based on the 2015 data, the total forest cover of the Philippines is estimated at 7.01 million hectares. Of the total forest cover, closed forest was accounted with an area of 2.03 million hectares, open forest with 4.68 million hectares, and mangrove forest with 0.30 million hectares [^1].\n \nForests are considered one of the most valuable natural resources in the Philippines [^2]. Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which are vital in building climate resilience in the country. Moreover, forests are essential in providing income and livelihood opportunities to upland communities. Upland families rely on forest resources for income and subsistence [^3].\n \nThe Philippine Master Plan for Climate Resilient Forestry Development, the country’s guide in the development and sustainable management of forests and forestlands, envisions the forestry sector to have a “Climate-resilient and sustainably managed watersheds and forest ecosystems, providing environmental and economic benefits to society.” To achieve this vision, programs and strategies identified for the sector include strengthening the resilience of forest ecosystems and communities to climate change, responding effectively to demands for forest ecosystems goods and services, and promoting responsive forest governance [^4].\n \nMoreover, based on the submitted Nationally Determined Contributions of the Philippines, it is one of the priorities of the country to pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based finance in forest conservation [^5].\n \n[^1]: DENR-FMB.

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015. The National Forest Programme would serve as an appropriate mechanism and provide a transparent and participatory process for planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and coordination of all forestry activities.",

              "description": "In Cambodia, the forestry administration is the government authority under the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, in managing forests and forest resources according to the National Forest Sector Policy and this law. National Forest defines forest as the unit of the natural ecosystem or plantation in the forms of wetland, lowland and dry land which covers by natural stands or plantation trees with a height from 5 meters on an area at least 0.5 ha with a canopy of more than 10 percent. The plantations such as rubber, oil palm, teak, acacia and eucalyptus and other kinds of trees which fall under the above criteria will also be classified as forests. Cambodia’s forests are mainly composed of mainly deciduous forest (17.65%) and evergreen forests (15.41%).\n \nCambodia, one of the countries with huge forest land covers in Southeast Asia, has lost more than 600,000 ha of forest, recording an unprecedented annual loss rate of 1.2% over the past five years. As of 2018, Cambodia’s forests, which were 59% of the total land area in 2006, have decreased to 46%, and now have 8,510,807 ha of forests, including rubber plantation, palm oil plantation, and other permanent crops. High demand for firewood and charcoal, illegal logging, unsustainable cycles of cultivation and weak law enforcement drive this rapid deforestation and degradation which is leading to a loss of biodiversity and land erosion, while flash floods could occur frequent. Conversion of land is primarily caused by commercial agriculture and extraction industries, adding pressure on Cambodia’s forestry sector. Currently, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has taken measures to address the issues by implementing policies and laws, and by joining the REDD+ initiative under the UNFCCC.\n \nThe National Forest Programme will be guided, among others, by the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, environmental sustainability and attainment of 60% forest cover by 2015.
